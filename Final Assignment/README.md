This is my code for the Creative Coding assignments. The final assignment used references from P5.js but it was built up and adapted from a test piece I made in class. I thought that the final piece would already have randomness in it if it was adapted from this and then I added a level of interactivity to it by adding a ball and a paddle that you can control with the LEFT and RIGHT keys.
